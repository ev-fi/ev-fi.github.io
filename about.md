Lives in Finland. Owns a Nissan Leaf. If you have any suggestions or just wish to chat, just go
to [https://github.com/ev-fi/ev-fi.github.io/issues](https://github.com/ev-fi/ev-fi.github.io/issues)
and click the "New Issue" button :-)

You're following my advices at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage to you, your property
or anything, or if you're killed or hurt by following my advices. I'm not an electrician myself.
If you need to be extra sure, call an electrician. You can then lower your taxes since
this falls under a house rennovation (up to 2400 EUR per year I think).
