title: EV Pricing In EU
---

Based on my observation, EV pricing in EU is suprisingly high when compared to
the US prices, which tends to surprise my US colleagues. I will therefore
demonstrate the whole process of EU car pricing on two cars: the Tesla Model 3 Long-Range
and the Tesla Model 3 SR+.

## Tesla Model 3 Long-Range

In the US:

1. [the base price is $48,990](https://www.tesla.com/model3/design?redirect=no#battery) 
2. Remove $3,875 incentives: $45,115
3. (not sure about this, but I think the cars are listed without VAT,
   so let's add 8% VAT to be sure): $48724
4. Add $1200 Tesla delivery fee: $49924

Now let's do the same, but this time in one randomly picked country in the EU (Finland):

1. Start with $48,990, which is 44006 €
2. Add 10% EU import tax of 4400 € to get 48406 €
3. Add 24% VAT of 11618 € to get 60024 € which will get you close
   to [official price of 59990 € in Finland](https://www.tesla.com/fi_FI/model3/design?redirect=no#battery).
5. Add car tax, which is around 2,6% for zero CO2-emmision car: +1576 € -> 61566 €
6. Since the price is now more than 50000 €, you will *not* receive a bonus of 2000 €
   from Finnish government for buying an EV.
6. Add 600 € Tesla delivery fee, to get the final car price: 62166 €

The final price is 62166 € which, when converted to dollars, is $69224. Compared to
the US price of $49924, the price in EU is $20000 or 38,6%
higher than the US price.

## Tesla Model 3 SR+

US:

1. [the base price is $39,990](https://www.tesla.com/model3/design?redirect=no#battery) 
2. Remove $3,875 incentives: $36115
3. (not sure about this, but I think the cars are listed without VAT,
   so let's add 8% VAT to be sure): $39004
4. Add $1200 Tesla delivery fee: $40204

Finland:

1. Start with $39,990, which is 35925 €
2. Add 10% EU import tax of 3592 € to get 39517 €
3. Add 24% VAT of 9484 € to get 49001 € which will get you close
   to [official price of 48690 € in Finland](https://www.tesla.com/fi_FI/model3/design?redirect=no#battery).
5. Add car tax, which is around 2,6% for zero CO2-emmision car: +1279 € -> 49969 €
6. Since the price is less than 50000 €, you will receive a bonus of 2000 €
   from Finnish government for buying an EV: 47969 €
6. Add 600 € Tesla delivery fee, to get the final car price: 48569 €

The final price is 48569 € which, when converted to dollars, is $54060. Compared to
the US price of $40204, the price in EU is $13856 or 34,4%
higher than the US price.
