title: Tesla Model 3 2020 - general maintenance
---

This article shows tips for maintenance of various car parts: replacing windshield
wipers, spare lug nuts, how to jack the car, etc.

## Spare wheel lug nuts

No idea where to buy spares, but they're not sold on [Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/category/ajoneuvon-lisavarusteet/model-3).
However, what you can do is to buy the [Wheel Locks/Lukkomutterit](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/product/lukkomutterit)
and replace 4 of the lug nuts with the lock ones. That will give you 4 spare lug nuts.

## Tightening the lug nuts

The tightening torque is 175 Nm; I recommend getting a proper torque spanner
such as [Momenttiavain 70-350 NM](https://www.biltema.fi/tyokalut/kasityokalut/hylsytyokalut/momenttiavaimet/momenttiavain-70-350-nm-2000030634).
The socket size is 21".

## Jacking

You can buy Model 3 jackpad literally in any Tesla-related shop, just google for
Tesla Model 3 Jack Pad. For example get one at [Jack Pad nostotyyny Tesla Model 3 @ vempele.com](https://www.vempele.fi/tuote/jack-pad-nostotyyny-tesla-3/).
Remember to get a low profile jack: Model 3 has only 140 cm of ground clearance,
further reduced by the size of the jack pad itself.
This [Aluminium/Steel Jack, 2.5 tonnes from Biltema](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/car---mc/workshop-equipment/lifting-equipment/car-jacks/aluminiumsteel-jack-25-tonnes-2000038408)
works well for me.

## Tyres

I took 18" since they are most practical: lowest road noise and lowest chance of flat tyre.
Their spec is `235/45 ZR 18`. Alternatively you can get 19" and 20" as well.

## Windshield wiper replacement

The only way to get replacement wipers appears to be via the [Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/category/ajoneuvon-lisavarusteet/model-3).

There seem to be no alternatives sold in Finland:
* The [Tesla Model 3 Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e85ugt/tesla_model_3_demystifying_the_wiper_blades/)
  suggests getting Bosch Aerotwin 3397014116 but they don't appear to be sold in Finland.
* The [Bosch Wiper Blade finder](https://www.boschwiperblades.com/) only seem to support
  Model S and Roadster; that suggests that there are no Bosch wipers for Model 3
  sold in Finland.
* The [The ULTIMATE Guide to Wiper Blades for your Tesla Model 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucF3bXqXeuw)
  suggests Michelin Advanced wipers, Bosch Icon 19OE or Rain-X Endura 19", neither of them appear to
  be sold in Finland.
