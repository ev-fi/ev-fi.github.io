title: Charging Network In Finland
---

Currently the situation is as everywhere else: lots of players with their own
smartphone app or a tag, which you need to have installed in order to charge.
Luckily, things are improving and several providers will now allow you to
charge simply by paying with your credit card (Tesla of course, but namely K-Lataus and PlugIt and
also maybe others). However, if you wish to go for a longer trip in Finland,
I still recommend you to register+get the tag at least with the biggest
charging network providers.

In this blog post I'll map the biggest providers. However, generally I recommend
to get tags/app from the following providers:

* [K-Lataus](https://www.k-lataus.fi): already big and getting bigger, nation-wide charging provider, recently
  teamed up with Ionity
* Ionity: EU-wide provider; only 3 online stations in Finland but it's expected
  that more will follow
* Fortum Charge&Drive: Scandinavia-wide provider
* Virta: lots of chargers but also a roaming partner with lots of EU providers
* PlugIt: couple of parking lots use this vendor

When doing a long trip, it's best to rely on providers with great reliability:
provides which have at least 4 fast DC charging stations on spot. Even in the worst case
if one is broken and two are used, you can still charge away.

I wouldn't rely on the following networks on longer trips:

* IKEA: free charging is a very nice bonus when shopping, however don't rely on
  these chargers when on a trip: the speed is only 3,3kW and often
  all four of the stations are used; because of the slow speed you would have to
  wait a hour before getting slowcharge.
* NewMotion (now Shell Recharge): a virtual roaming operator:
  they don't have own chargers but they have a lot of roaming agreements, and they
  will take a small fee on top. However, usually the total charging fee is shown as
  "unknown" in the app, it's a bit like buying a cat in the bag. Get a token,
  but use it only in case of great need.
* Possibly others; I'll add them.

## Planning A Route

Simply use [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/); then
make sure to plan your route only for charging operator with "Great" reliability.

## Tesla Superchargers

* Map: [Official Map of chargers](https://www.tesla.com/fi_FI/findus),
[Unofficial Map of chargers](https://supercharge.info/map)
* Payments: you don't need any app/tag - the payments go directly to your Tesla account and
to your credit card.
* Charging speed: 120kW DC
* Cost: 0,25€ per kWh: good price
* Reliability: great (usually 4-12 DC chargers on site)
* Availability: decent, new chargers planned

Tesla has an immense advantage of having its own private network of superchargers.
The superchargers usually work, and even if there is a broken station, there are
4 or even 8 stations in one place, therefore the charger network is very reliable.
However, no other EV brands can not charge at Tesla chargers.

The unofficial map benefits from updates from people all around the world,
and it is often more up-to-date than the official map (e.g. regarding the chargers
being built).

The ease of use is phenomenal: the car will simply plan a route for you, with
Supercharger visits as need be, you don't have to plan much yourself.

Unfortunately there are no Superchargers in Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania yet (planned for 2020/2021).

## K-Lataus

* [Map](https://app.k-lataus.fi/profile)
* Payments: either with a tag, or K-Lataus mobile app (which fequently logs me out
  and is quite annoying to use; I really recommend getting the tag)
* Charging speed: 50kW DC, 22kW AC
* Cost: 0,2€ DC 50kW DC charging, 0,02€ at 22kW AC charging (beware - your car
  might only charge at 11kW or less)
* Reliability: great (usually 4 AC chargers and 2 DC chargers on site)
* Availability: great (most chargers in southern Finland, but also has charger e.g. in Rovaniemi)

A new nation-wide provider, however it's quite big and getting bigger. I recommend
this network because of good price, reliability and availability.

K-Lataus has recently partnered with Ionity; it looks like the K-Lataus tag
will now start charging on Ionity (plus you'll get Plussa points), however this
is not confirmed.

This operator is only in Finland - there are no K-Lataus
chargers in Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania/Poland.

## IONITY

* [Map](https://ionity.eu/)
* Payments: with mobile app
* Charging speed: 350kW DC
* Cost: 8€ per charging session. If you need to fill up your tank, this is the
  cheapest and fastest option.
* Reliability: great in EU, fair in Finland (2 DC chargers on site)

An EU-wide network of cheap and fast chargers. In Finland there are only three
charging sites as of now, but new ones will be opened. Also, Ionity has roaming
agreement with Latvia LV with prices of 0,15€/min; so if you travel to Poland
by car then I definitely recommend getting IONITY.

## Virta

TODO

Virta has a good roaming coverage throughout the EU, notably with the exception
of Lithuania and Poland. The roaming prices are decent.

## Fortum Charge&Drive

## PlugSurfing

TODO

# Visiting EU by car

If you can, take a route through Sweden. Sweden, Denmark and Germany has excellent
coverage of IONITY+Tesla chargers (more than enough for planning a trip), additionally
with Virta/PlugSurfing roaming.

The road through Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania/Poland is very good in terms of road quality,
but there are no chargers with "great" reliability - usually it's just one stand
with one AC plug and one DC plug. If it's broken or occupied, be prepared for a fallback
plan to find alternative charger. However often it's enough to call the number
on the charger - the operator can then reboot the charger which is often enough to
get the charger up-and-running.

In Latvia, try to use IONITY instead of PlugSurfing: CSDD charging costs 0,15€/min
with IONITY, but 0,273€/min with PlugSurfing (still quite a decent price though).

In Poland, I registered for GreenWay chargers - there are quite a lot of charging
places (even though they only host 1AC+1DC charger, so the reliability rating is "fair").
