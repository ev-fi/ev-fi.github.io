## Spare wheel lug nuts

Long story short - after much searching I've finally found out that
Nissan Leaf 2015 uses M12 1,25 lug nuts; you can buy spare for example from
Biltema: [Wheel Nut Kit M12 x 1,25, 35mm, Art. 33-3305](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/car---mc/styling/exterior-styling/wheel-nuts-10-pcs-2000019355).

## Tightening the lug nuts

The tightening torque is 112 NM; I recommend getting a proper torque spanner
such as [Momenttiavain 70-350 NM](https://www.biltema.fi/tyokalut/kasityokalut/hylsytyokalut/momenttiavaimet/momenttiavain-70-350-nm-2000030634).

## Jacking

Nissan Leaf's underbody is not flat but instead there is a pinch rail or
a pinch weld; this [nissan leaf jack video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abbDGR60NsE)
contains more information.

What's totally weird is that I've failed to buy pinch rail jack adapter in Finland.
The Nissan dealership, Motonet and also Fixus simply told me that it's not being
sold in Finland, and that I should simply jack the car and risk twisting of the pinch rail.
Probably everyone simply uses a hockey puck or similar. The best thing
is therefore to order a pinch rail jack adapter from AliExpress or Amazon and have
it delivered to Finland.

## Tyres

## Windshield replacement

* Rear windshield: 250mm; I bought Bosch Rear H250 wiper (TODO where)
* Front windshield:
   * Driver: 650mm Hybrid (UNVERIFIED)

Where to buy them:

* [Biltema: Nissan Leaf Wiper Blades](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/search-page/?query=wiper%20blade%20nissan%20leaf)
  but they're frequently out-of-stock
* TODO where else? Prisma? K-Rauta? Kodin Terra?
