title: Jeda USB Hub and Jeda Wireless Pad
---

After purchasing a Qi-wirelessly charged phone, I decided to order both the
[Jeda Wireless Pad](https://getjeda.com/tesla-wireless-phone-charger/) (in order
to charge my phone) and [Jeda USB Hub](https://getjeda.com/tesla-model3-usb-hub/)
(in order to hide my TeslaCam SSD drive).

After these products arrived, I found out they're basically useless to me ;)

## The Jeda USB Hub

The installation procedure was very well described and I managed to install the hub
rather easily into the car. The hub is well built and fits the interior really well.

Unfortunately, the slot for the SSD drive is very small and works
only with SSD drives of certain shape and connector placement; clearly doesn't
work with my Seagate Expansion 500GB SSD:

As it turned out, I was unable to put even the wireless charger into use, and thus
I had no need for additional USB slots provided by the USB hub either :-D

## The Jeda Wireless Charger

The installation procedure is straightforward - remove the old rubber mat and place
the wireless charger in its place, connecting it via provided USB cables.

Unfortunately the Jeda Wireless Charger is very thick and I was simply unable
to close the lid in my Model 3 after I placed the phone onto the charger.
The reason is that I
tend to use wrap cases for my phone which makes the phone very thick.

> I also suspect that the case completely prevents the Qi wireless charging, but I
still have to test this one properly.

Also as I found out during my 3-day trip, I never actually needed to charge the phone
in the car. I simply always charged the phone overnight at the motel. This realization
rendered the wireless charger useless for me.

## Verdict

Both products are solidly built and of high quality. Unfortunately, they simply won't
fit my use-case.
