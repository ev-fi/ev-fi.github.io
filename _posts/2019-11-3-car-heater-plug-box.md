title: Charging From Car Heater Plug Box (Piharasia)
---

You should only charge from a car heater box which you own, since we'll need to modify it a bit, to get rid of the 2-hour limitation.
Also, make sure that the car heater box is connected to your own private electric meter, otherwise you'll use
electricity paid for by everybody.

However, often it is possible to get a deal with the housing company, to pay
around 30 EUR per month (the money is negotiable) for unlimited charging from
the heater box.

## Removing 2-hour Limit

To beat the 2-hour limit, you can buy a [replacement electric hour wheel](https://www.kodinterra.fi/fi/terra/theben-ip20-ajastin-24h-valkoinen).
With that, you can replace the 2-hour-fixed hour wheel in your Car Heater Box with this configurable wheel; you can then
simply configure the wheel to be always on. However, first make sure that the Car Heater Box is compatible with such a wheel;
for example [Fibox Piharasia](https://www.k-rauta.fi/rautakauppa/piharasia-piha-2a2j1v-val).

To open the Fibox box, just unscrew the 2 screws, then plug out the old hour wheel, plug in the replacement one, put the lid back and screw
the screws back - that's all. MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF ALL THE FUSES FIRST, both in the Fibox box and in your house fuse box.
When finished, turn the fuses back on, configure the hour wheel to be always on, and try out that the hour wheel provides
electricity (e.g. by plugging in a cellphone charger).

## Plugging The Charger Into The Box

If your car charger has connector plug with a bent cable out, that's excellent: it will fit inside of the Heater Plug Box.
You can then plug the charger plug directly into the hour wheel and lead the
cable outside of the Car Heater Plug Box, without any need for extension cord.
However, my charger had connector plug with straight cable out which wouldn't fit inside of the
Car Heater Plug Box. Therefore I had to buy an extension cord with bent connector cable -
the straight connector wouldn't fit in. Unfortunately I couldn't find a proper durable IP44 outdoor extension cord with
the straight connector, that's why I bought an inside one: [JATKOJOHTO OPAL 1-OSAINEN MAADOITETTU 5M](https://www.k-rauta.fi/rautakauppa/s%C3%A4hk%C3%B6--valaistus-ja-turvallisuus/sahkotarvikkeet/jatkojohdot-ja-kelat/jatkojohto-opal-1-osainen-maadoitettu-5m).

* Since the cable is not rated for outside use, I had to make sure that both ends are absolutely insulated from water.
  Luckily, one end is well-protected inside of the Car Heater Plug Box itself; I've wrapped the other end with the Suojakotelo
  (mentioned in the previous blog).
* The cable wires are only 1,5mm thick, which means 10A charging tops. I've used the cable to charge the car for 1 month at 10A so far, without
  any issues.

To reduce mechanical stress on the hour wheel, I've added a duct tape onto the cable in the spot where it leaves the
Car Heater Plug Box. This way, the cable is supported by the duct tape and is not hanging on the hour wheel itself.

The photo of my setup. Note the always-on hour-wheel connected to the white extension cord. The
extension cord is wrapped by duck-tape just before it leaves the Plug Box, to protect
the hour-wheel from mechanical stress. The white extension cord is protected by the
suojakotelo where it connects to the Zencar charger. The Zencar is firmly attached to the wall;
the car charging cable is wrapped around the Plug Box. The suojakotelo and the cables are
hidden beneath a wooden staircase.
