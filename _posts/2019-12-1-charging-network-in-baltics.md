title: Charging Network In Baltics
---

The road through Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania/Poland is very good in terms of road quality,
but there are no chargers with "great" reliability - usually it's just one stand
with one AC plug and one DC plug. If it's broken or occupied, be prepared for a fallback
plan to find alternative charger. 

Please take this information with a grain of salt - I've never used the chargers
myself (even though I plan to). Please let me know if there are any issues.

# General Tips

* Plan the trip first. You can use [A Better Route Planner](abetterrouteplanner.com/), however
  make sure you have at least 15%-20% battery left to reach next charger if the one
  is broken or occupied.
* If the DC charger is broken, try to call the phone number on the charger. There is
  now EU-wide roaming so the calls are generally cheap; the support should speak English
  and may be able to reboot the charger remotely, fixing the issue.
* If the DC charger is occupied and you can not wait, try to find nearest
  charging station via [PlugShare](https://www.plugshare.com/)
  and take a break there. However, if that one is broken, you may be
  forced to call a towing service, or find the next charger.
* It's best to prefer city-based chargers, since there are generally much more
  alternative chargers around.

## Tesla Chargers

There are no Tesla chargers in the Baltic states as of now (2019), neither there are any chargers
above Warsaw in Poland. The chargers are planned and should be erected in 2020,
you can see the [official Tesla Charger Map](https://www.tesla.com/fi_FI/findus/) to get more information.

The [SuperCharge.info](https://supercharge.info/map) receives updates from Tesla
user community and thus keeps most up-to-date charger map.

# Estonia

[Virta](https://virta.webapp.virtaglobal.com/) operates a couple of chargers in Estonia,
and the one in Parnu is a 50kW free-to-use charger. Awesome!

[Elmo](http://elmo.ee/charging-network/) operates a nation-wide network of chargers
in Estonia. The prices are excellent - 4,5 EUR per charging session, regardless
of kWh used. I haven't used this network yet, but it definitely sounds very useful
and worth of registering. WARNING: Elmo doesn't seem to use CCD connectors,
they only use CHAdeMO (and Type 2 for slow AC 22kW charging).
So for example for Model 3 you'll need an adapter.

No known roaming with PlugSurfing.

# Latvia

[CSDD](https://www.csdd.lv/en/) is a national road mainaining authority that
also owns chargers.
You may either register at [e-mobi](https://portal.e-mobi.lv/lv/sakumlapa/) to charge,
or actually use the IONITY app to charge at all
CSDD chargers at the same price as if you registered at CSDD.
CSDD charging costs 0,15€/min
with IONITY, but 0,273€/min with PlugSurfing (still quite a decent price though).

[IONITY](https://ionity.eu) roams with CSDD chargers with no additional price,
so this is great way to reuse your Ionity account.

[PlugSurfing](https://www.plugsurfing.com/map) also roams with CSDD chargers but
it's more expensive than Ionity roaming or e-mobi prices.

# Lithuania

According to PlugShare there are state-owned chargers which are free to use, so
it's preferable to use those.

There is also another operator [Charge LT](http://bit.ly/Charge-LT) but it's not known
what's the pricing or how to register.

No known roaming with PlugSurfing.

# Poland

The biggest charging operator in Poland is [GreenWay Polska](https://greenwaypolska.pl/en/).
The prices are expensive (0,49€ per kWh, with additional time-based penalty when charging more
than 45/60 minutes), but there is no other operator. It's highly recommended
to register with GreenWay, since it is the most common charging network in Poland by far.
There are quite a lot of charging
places (even though they only host 1AC+1DC charger, so the reliability rating is "fair").

PlugSurfing has no roaming in Poland.

There are Tesla superchargers in Poland, but they're not close to the Lithuania
borders. However, there are additional superchargers planned in 2020.

Surprisingly [Fortum Charge&Drive](https://map.chargedrive.com/en/) has a charger
in Warsaw and Krakow, you might try those out.
