title: Home Charging in Finland - Revisited
---

In the [Home Charging in Finland - Basics](../home-charging-finland-basics/)
article
I've described the basic options of charging in Finland, and I have concluded that
Schuko-based charging makes the most sense. However, recently
I've found a 800 EUR option for a wall-mounted charger which includes the RCA/RCCD
fuse and the installation, which makes it very competitive against the Schuko
charging.

I've found the following page [virtane.fi/sahkoautoilu/omakotitalo](https://www.virtane.fi/sahkoautoilu/omakotitalo/)
which allows you to simply input your address, and afterwards a list of
companies and prices will be presented, each listing the charger along with the
installation price.

For my address a Vantaa-based Wolttinen Oy vendor was chosen, which offers
the [Wolttinen XL Wallbox 16 A 3-vaihe 11KW](https://autonlataus.com/collections/wallbox/products/wolt1c-xl-16a-3v-11kw)
station for ~500 EUR, and the installation work for 300 EUR, which is an excellent price.

The big question left open is whether my fuse box is compatible with 3-phase
charging station. The virtane.fi allows you to take pictures of the fuse box,
wirings and the installation site however, which allows the vendor to take a look
beforehand and calculate the installation price beforehand.

I haven't made offer to the guys just yet, but I'll post more once I'll get
any updates.
